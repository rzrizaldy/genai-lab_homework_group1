      "Every day, millions of shoppers hit the stores in full force—both online and on foot—searching frantically for the perfect gift. . . . Americans [spend] over $30 billion at retail stores in the month of December alone. [Yet] many dread the thought of buying gifts; they worry that their purchases will disappoint rather than delight the intended recipients.\n",
      "With this paragraph, Stanford University Graduate School of Business researchers Francis J. Flynn and Gabrielle S. Adams introduce their study “Money Can’t Buy Love: Asymmetric Beliefs About Gift Price and Feelings of Appreciation,” published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology (Vol. 45, 2009). The researchers investigated the relationship between the price paid for a gift and the level of appreciation felt by the recipient. Gift-givers who spend more money on a gift often do so to send a strong signal of their love to the recipient. The researchers theorized that these gift-givers would expect the recipient to express a high level of appreciation for the gift. However, the researchers did not expect gift-recipients to associate a greater level of appreciation with a higher gift price. That is, “The link between gift price and feelings of appreciation will be stronger for gift-givers than for gift-recipients.”\n",
      "To test this theory, the researchers conducted an experimental study involving a representative sample of 237 adults from across the nation. Each subject completed an online survey in exchange for a $5 gift certificate to a major online retailer. The survey asked questions about a birthday gift that the subject either received or gave. The participants were randomly assigned to the role of either gift-giver or gift-receiver. (In other words, gift-givers were asked about a birthday gift they recently gave, while gift-recipients were asked about a birthday gift they recently received.) Gifts of cash, gift cards, or gift certificates were excluded from the study. Data were collected on the following variables measured for each participant:\n",
